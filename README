Thinkpad SL510 Thermal v. 0.1

Due to the fact that the normal Thinkpad SL510 fan control sucks pretty hard under linux, I've written this little daemon.

It overwrites the firmware's fan settings and sends it own instead.

I've increased the working temperature to 43 to 50 degrees Celsius, so the fan will stay quiet most of the time. Actually, I have no idea how this will affect your hardware's lifetime!

This daemon requires the thinkpad_acpi module!
